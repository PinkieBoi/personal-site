Mood: Tired

I was up and down all last night (and part of this morning) with dreams that focus on my biggest fears and worries, each time waking up covered in sweat with a pounding headache.  It's only day 2 and already I want to give up and quit.  I had hoped that on mirtazapine I would at least get a good night's sleep but it seems that I won't be so lucky this time around - maybe these side effects will diminish with time but I'm not hopeful for that either, I remember that last time I was on this medication once the dreams started they were here to stay.
