Mood: Slightly Positive

My sleep has continued to improve - I only got up once in the night last night and I don't recall having any nightmares which is a rarity for me.  Looking back over the previos 5 nights I'm becoming more optimistic that this might actually work for me - I'm totally aware that this optimism is essentially setting myself up for major disappointment but hey, I only promised effort and for me that has always meant 6 months.
I should also note that I'm nowhere near what most people regard as a decent baseline yet but still, something is not nothing!

Last night I started coding up the 80s Atart game Breakout.  I've got it to the point where it resembles a single player squash (no blocks to bust) and I plan to finish that up when I get home from my medication review with my GP.
