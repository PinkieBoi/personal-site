Mood:  Meh / Average

Today I contacted my GP and restarted antidepressants.  To be clear I'm doing this solely to fulfil a promise - not because I expect any improvement. I promised that I'd make a real effort to recover so I'm on the drug that several US studies show is best for my particular circumstances.  This blog will serve as a record for me to look back on so that I can, at the very least, look back and accurately evaluate any progress I might make towartds stable mental health.

This blog will also serve as a practical way for me to learn to properly use the static site generator, Hugo and display my progress in learning the python programming language.
