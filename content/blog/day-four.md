Mood: Optimistic

After only waking 3 times last night I am, for the first time in a long time, actually feeling somewhat rested!  I had to listen to my stories to first drift off to sleep because I couldn't stop myself daydreaming about 'The Detective' but once I actually got myself down I didn't need to use them again.  Other than that I think I'm actually starting to feel my medication start to take effect. I'm much less focused on my own demise and have even had a few thoughts of the future - something I didn't expect quite so soon.
Maybe this will actually work for me...

As for my learning python, I'm almost finished the typing tutor project.  I'm not totally happy with version 1 but it will do until I can be bothered to animate the keyboard image and the text. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to implement the backspace key yet so I'll have to work that out first before I can make it function the way I think it should.
