Looking back over the previos 5 nights I\u0026rsquo;m becoming more optimistic that this might actually work for me - I\u0026rsquo;m totally aware that this optimism is essentially setting myself up for major disappointment but hey, I only promised effort and for me that has always meant 6 months. I should also note that I\u0026rsquo;m nowhere near what most people regard as a decent baseline yet but still, something is not nothing!\nLast night I started coding up the 80s Atart game Breakout.

Other than that I think I\u0026rsquo;m actually starting to feel my medication start to take effect.

I\u0026rsquo;m not totally happy with version 1 but it will do until I can be bothered to animate the keyboard image and the text.

I had hoped that on mirtazapine I would at least get a good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep but it seems that I won\u0026rsquo;t be so lucky this time around - maybe these side effects will diminish with time but I\u0026rsquo;m not hopeful for that either, I remember that last time I was on this medication once the dreams started they were here to stay.\n","date":" 1 March 2025","permalink":"/blog/day-two/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Day Two"},{"content":"Mood: Meh / Average\nToday I contacted my GP and restarted antidepressants.
